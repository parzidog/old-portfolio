After leaving military service, I worked as a foreman for a commercial construction company where I simultaneously ran up to 3 job sites before deciding to go back to school and obtain my degree in engineering while simultaneously working up to three jobs. It was at this time that I discovered my love for computers and computer programming. While attending college full-time, I taught myself C/C++, Python, HTML and CSS programming languages before deciding to pursue a formal education in Software Engineering with a focus in Javascript and web development.</p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"experience\">\n                <h1><Typewriter\n                        options={{\n                            strings: ['EXPERIENCE'],\n                            autoStart: true,\n                            loop: true,\n                            deleteSpeed: 2,\n                        }}\n                    /></h1>\n                {jobs.map(job=>{\n                    return(\n                        <div className=\"singleJob\">\n                            <h3 className=\"companyName\">{job.name}</h3>\n                            <p className=\"date\">{job.date}</p>\n                            <div className=\"jobDetails\">\n                                <ul>\n                                    {job.description.map(bullet=>{\n                                        return(\n                                            <li>{bullet}</li>\n                                        )\n                                    })}\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    )\n                })} \n            </div>\n            <div className=\"education\">\n                <h1><Typewriter\n                        options={{\n                            strings: ['EDUCATION'],\n                            autoStart: true,\n                            loop: true,\n                            deleteSpeed: 2,\n                        }}\n                    /></h1>\n                <div className=\"singleInstitute\">\n                    <p className=\"date\">2022</p>\n                    <h4 className=\"instituteName\">Amazon Web Services</h4>\n                    <h3 className=\"certification\">AWS Cloud Practitioner</h3>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"singleInstitute\">\n                    <p className=\"date\">2022</p>\n                    <h4 className=\"instituteName\">Fullstack Academy</h4>\n                    <h3 className=\"certification\">Full Stack Software Engineer</h3>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"singleInstitute\">\n                    <p className=\"date\">2023</p>\n                    <h4 className=\"instituteName\">Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University</h4>\n                    <h3 className=\"certification\">A.
